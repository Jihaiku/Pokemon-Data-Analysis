# Pokemon-Data-Analysis
I go over a kaggle dataset that has all of the pokemon up to generation VII. 

To start with, I just clean up the data and make sure that nothing is duplicated or null values then I started to make simple visualizations from the data. 

I decided to focus on finding the most common type combination based on the two types if they were grouped together. The highest grouping was Normal/Flying (type1/type2) with 26 pokemon so I then shown some stat distributions for them and wrapped it up with some results from there. 

Below are two of the primary visualizations of each individual types. Which goes to show that just because the two primary types in these groupings do not necessarily mean that together they are the biggest grouping.

I will probably come back to this dataset later when I can find a proper visualization where I can show all six primary stats in one visualization like they do in the older pokemon books.
