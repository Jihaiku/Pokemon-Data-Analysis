# Pokemon-Data-Analysis
I go over a kaggle dataset that has all of the pokemon up to generation VII. 

To start with, I just clean up the data and make sure that nothing is duplicated or null values then I started to make simple visualizations from the data. 

I decided to focus on finding the most common type combination based on the two types if they were grouped together. The highest grouping was Normal/Flying (type1/type2) with 26 pokemon so I then shown some stat distributions for them and wrapped it up with some results from there. 

Below are two of the primary visualizations of each individual types. Which goes to show that just because the two primary types in these groupings do not necessarily mean that together they are the biggest grouping.

After some time and some research later on I found something called a swarmplot from a gentleman named Andrew Gele and I wanted to try it out now that the data was updated for the newest generation and it works very well as a visual albeit one that I cannot fully appreciate myself since I'm having a hard time discerning anything on it.

My next goal for expanding on this project is going into a deeper dive on each pokemon generation or probably each pokemon type in terms of total and individual stats.
